            <p class="article-content">Currently I am working at Ubisoft, as a junior Audio Designer.
                I have a passion for coding and am slowly diggin more and more into the technical side of things.<br>
                I know about automating Wwise, maintaining a a project in a larger and smaller scale. <br>
                Also can create naming conventions and force people to stick to them.<br>
                Conversion setting knowledge is also there and optimizing a for shipping is also possible <br>
                Besides all the tech stuff I also like to create tech sounds <br>
